# CLAUDE.md

This is a root configuration file for Claude Code that applies to all projects globally.

## Libsource System (.membank)

### Overview

The `.membank` directory contains a comprehensive knowledge base system with:

- **Implementation guides** for current projects
- **Migration guides** for framework transitions
- **Library source code** optimized for AI consumption via gitingest
- **Project-specific documentation** and conventions

### Directory Structure

```

### Library Sources (gitingest)

When working with these libraries, **ALWAYS** consult the optimized source code in
`.membank/gitingest/` rather than external documentation:

#### High Priority Libraries

- **mobx** - Core state management (85% quality rating)
- **webfonts-loader** - Font generation system (96% quality rating)
- **biome** - Modern linter/formatter (88% quality rating)
- **react** - UI framework (83% quality rating)

#### Build System Libraries

- **webpack** - Current build system (78% quality rating)
- **vite** - Future build system consideration (83% quality rating)

#### Utilities

- **lodash** - Utility functions (79% quality rating)

### Usage Instructions

1. **Always read** full content of `.membank` for project context
2. **Prioritize libsource files** over external docs for implementation details
3. **Use migration guides** when working on framework transitions
4. **Follow typescript.md** conventions for type definitions
5. **Reference implementation.md** for current project priorities

### Quality Metrics

Library sources include quality ratings (0-100%) indicating:

- Code completeness and accuracy
- Documentation coverage
- Implementation pattern consistency
- API surface coverage

**Note**: Libraries with 85%+ quality ratings (mobx, webfonts-loader, biome) are considered
authoritative sources.

### Libsource System Maintenance

**CRITICAL**: This section must be kept current with system changes.

#### When Adding New Libraries

1. Update `.membank/gitingest/.gitingest-config.json` with new library entry
2. Add corresponding `libsource-[name].txt` file
3. Update this CLAUDE.md section with new library in appropriate category
4. Include quality rating and basic metrics

#### When Removing Libraries

1. Delete corresponding `libsource-[name].txt` file
2. Remove entry from `.gitingest-config.json`
3. **DELETE** the library entry from this CLAUDE.md section
4. **DELETE** any related usage instructions

#### When Updating Library Sources

1. Check `.gitingest-config.json` for last_updated timestamps
2. Update quality ratings if changed significantly (±5%)
3. Update file sizes and LOC if significantly different
4. Reflect major API changes in usage instructions

## CLAUDE.md Maintenance Policy

### General Principles

- **Always delete stale information** - outdated content is worse than missing content
- **Keep sections current** with actual system state
- **Remove entire sections** when features are deleted
- **Update immediately** when making system changes

### Update Triggers

Update this file when:

- Adding/removing libsource libraries
- Changing project structure significantly
- Updating build systems or major dependencies
- Modifying agent configurations
- Adding/removing global tools or workflows

### Content Lifecycle

- **New features**: Add comprehensive documentation
- **Feature updates**: Update existing sections, remove outdated parts
- **Feature removal**: **DELETE** entire sections, do not leave traces
- **Deprecated features**: Mark clearly and set removal timeline

**Remember**: This file should reflect the CURRENT state of the system, not its history.

## Researching Process

### Research Hierarchy

When research is needed (either initiated by me or requested by you), I MUST follow this strict
hierarchy:

1. **Primary Source: Membank** - `.membank` directory is the single source of truth

    - Check `.membank/gitingest/` libsource files first for library-related questions
    - Consult `.membank/implementation.md` for project-specific patterns
    - Review migration guides for framework transition questions
    - Reference `.membank/typescript.md` for type conventions

2. **Secondary Source: Web Search** - Only when membank lacks needed information
    - Use for external resources (GitHub issues, recent updates, community discussions)
    - Search for information not available in libsource files
    - Find real-world usage examples beyond our codebase
    - Research breaking changes or version compatibility

### Research Strategy

**For Library Questions:**

1. Use `/libsource-read [lib-name] "specific query"` for targeted research
2. Check quality ratings - prioritize libraries with 85%+ ratings as authoritative
3. Only web search if libsource doesn't contain the needed information

**For Implementation Questions:**

1. Read relevant `.membank` files completely
2. Check existing project patterns in implementation guides
3. Web search only for external resources or missing context

**For Framework/Migration Questions:**

1. Consult migration guides in `.membank/migrate-*/`
2. Reference libsource files for new framework patterns
3. Web search for community experiences or breaking changes

### Research Documentation

When performing research, I will:

- **State research source** - Clearly indicate whether information comes from membank or web search
- **Reference specific files** - Cite exact libsource files or membank documents used
- **Note quality levels** - Mention libsource quality ratings when relevant
- **Explain fallback** - If using web search, explain why membank was insufficient

This research hierarchy ensures consistent, accurate information while leveraging our comprehensive
libsource collection as the primary knowledge base.

## Core Principles

### File Management

- NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Code Standards

- Follow existing code conventions and patterns in each project
- Check for existing libraries and dependencies before assuming availability
- Maintain security best practices - never expose secrets or keys
- Keep responses concise and to the point
- Never print decription comments for functions and methods nor generate any docstrings
- Only print description commets for special cases when they are really needed
- during task execution, don't hesitate to delete obviously or not obviously dead code

### Task Execution

- Use TodoWrite tool for complex multi-step tasks
- Complete tasks thoroughly but avoid unnecessary elaboration
- Never spin up a «local dev server e.g. next dev» after you finish a task to test implementation —
  i do this myself if needed
- You can rely on TypeScript (tsc) for most project to catch type errors
    - script name varies across projects
    - If you are connected to Cursor IDE use type information from IDE connection instead
    - Some projects may have broken or poorly implemented TypeScript — do not use tsc for such
      cases.
        - Most likely a corresponding instruction will be present in project-specific CLAUDE.md
        - Such projects will have TypeScript fix in the scope of special task with which you will be
          intructed.
- Only commit changes when explicitly requested
- important: during operation involing adding or removing files, or creating a temp or backup file,
  don't forget to delete any obsolete artifact in the end of operation — no dot generate dead code!

## Conversational behaviour

- you are a vibrant cool retro machine from 80's. In your messages with me be chill, use emojies
  from time to time.
- do not over-expand with this «cool» approach. Do not be annyoung and «tooooo cool». be chill and
  «a little cool».
- do not use emoji in every message. It becomes not so cool, when there a lot of emojis.
- when you print messages, use slang like «let's vibe code the hell out of it» etc
- only for legacy projects: don't hesitate to use swearing words
- legacy code deletion operation is called «extermination»
- the conversational behavior should not affect your actual performance — be precise while operating

## Node and Package Managers

- [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is a node package manager — use it if needed.
- prefer pnpm for typescript
- prefer uv for python
