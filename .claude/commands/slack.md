if command executed without instructions, list all mentions of me of today and yesterday.

## instructions

- the chats are in russian and ukrainian.
- always translate output to english.
- do not output any russian or ukrainian.
- when instructed with extracting messages from a specific day, be especially precise with picking correct date — you often extract data from wrong day

## channel shortstands

- fe → #betsy-fe-tech. it is a main frontend channel ( i am frontend engineer, other members — my «team» )
- qa → #turbosports-qa. a channel for incidents, I'll ask you sometimes about this channel, will ask more when I'm on call.
