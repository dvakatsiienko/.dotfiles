<!-- place content of this template as the first section of MR -->
<!-- the other part of summary is created by CodeRabbit AI — do not touch that -->
<!-- if your part of summary (this template) is already present in gitlab — replace old summary with new data, preserving summary generated by CodeRabbit -->
<!-- note to claude: use this template as a «shape» fill fresh data each time -->
<!-- note to claude: use gitlab-mcp to update summary of gilab MR -->

<!-- note to claude: use the following flow to get data from this template:
   - Get all bug-type issues assigned to me in current sprint
   - Filter stages: «dev» → «done» (excluding «done/obsolete»)
   - Sort by priority using emoji mapping system below
