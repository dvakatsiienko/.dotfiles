# Jira to Archon Workflow: Streamlined Issue Management

## Overview

This workflow enables seamless translation of Jira issues into structured Archon tasks, transforming poorly organized bug reports into comprehensive resolution plans. The process enhances productivity by creating actionable, detailed tasks with clear technical context.

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Setup
```bash
# Jira MCP server configuration (one-time setup)
claude mcp add-json jira-mcp '{"type": "sse", "url": "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse"}' -s user

# Verification
claude mcp list  # Should show jira-mcp as ✓ Connected
```

### 2. Data Extraction Process

#### A. Retrieve Assigned Issues
```javascript
// Get current user's assigned issues
mcp__jira-mcp__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql({
  cloudId: "CLOUD_ID",
  jql: "assignee = currentUser() ORDER BY updated DESC",
  maxResults: 10,
  fields: ["key", "summary", "description", "status", "issuetype", "priority", "created", "updated", "assignee"]
})
```

#### B. Extract Detailed Information
```javascript
// Get full issue details including attachments
mcp__jira-mcp__getJiraIssue({
  cloudId: "CLOUD_ID", 
  issueIdOrKey: "ISSUE-KEY"
})
```

### 3. Information Transformation Matrix

| Jira Field | Archon Task Field | Transformation Logic |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `summary` | `title` | Translate to English, make actionable |
| `description` | `description` | Extract repro steps, environment, resolution plan |
| `priority` | `task_order` | High=13, Medium=8-10, Low=5-7 |
| `status` | Status mapping | Dev Test OK → todo, Dev → todo, In Progress → in_progress |
| `labels` | `feature` | Map to feature categories (search-ui, video-player, etc.) |
| `attachments` | `sources` | Screenshot URLs and video content references |

### 4. Task Creation Template

```javascript
mcp__archon-mcp__manage_task({
  action: "create",
  project_id: "PROJECT_UUID",
  title: "Actionable task title",
  description: `
**Problem:** Clear problem statement

**Environment:**
- URLs: Specific test URLs
- Device: Target devices and viewports  
- Configuration: Partner monitor settings

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Step-by-step reproduction
2. Specific actions and inputs
3. Expected vs actual behavior

**Technical Details:**
- Jira Issue: Original issue key
- Status: Current development status
- Priority: Business priority level
- Assets: Available screenshots/videos

**Resolution Plan:**
1. Technical analysis steps
2. Implementation approach
3. Testing requirements
4. Validation criteria
  `,
  assignee: "AI IDE Agent",
  task_order: 8, // Based on priority mapping
  feature: "search-ui", // Categorized feature area
  sources: [
    {
      "url": "JIRA-ISSUE-KEY", 
      "type": "jira_issue", 
      "relevance": "Original bug report"
    }
  ]
})
```

## Feature Categorization System

### Search & Navigation
- **search-ui**: Search functionality, overlays, positioning
- **search-implementation**: Core search logic and API integration
- **search-refactoring**: Code quality and architecture improvements

### Media & Interaction  
- **video-player**: Live streams, fullscreen, player controls
- **lazy-loading**: Performance optimization, scroll behavior

### Technical Infrastructure
- **responsive-design**: Cross-device compatibility
- **performance**: Loading, rendering optimization

## Priority Mapping Algorithm

```javascript
const priorityToTaskOrder = {
  "Highest": 15,
  "High": 12-13, 
  "Medium": 8-10,
  "Low": 5-7,
  "Lowest": 3-5
}

// Additional factors:
// +2 for "Dev Test OK" (ready for review)
// +1 for "foundByMainTest" label (QA validated)
// -1 for "In Progress" (currently being worked)
```

## Asset Extraction Guidelines

### Screenshots & Videos
- **Available**: Jira attachments with direct download URLs
- **Extraction**: Use attachment metadata from issue details
- **Integration**: Reference in task sources for visual context
- **Formats**: PNG screenshots, MOV screen recordings

### Technical Environment Details
```javascript
// Extract from Jira description patterns:
const environmentRegex = {
  urls: /https:\/\/[^\s\)]+/g,
  viewports: /(\d{4}x\d{3,4})/g,
  browsers: /(chrome|firefox|safari|edge)/gi,
  devices: /(mobile|tablet|desktop)/gi
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Workflow Effectiveness
- **Issue Translation Speed**: <2 minutes per issue
- **Context Preservation**: 95% of technical details captured
- **Resolution Plan Quality**: Actionable steps with clear validation criteria

### Asset Recovery
- **Screenshot Extraction**: ✅ Successful for issues with attachments
- **Video Content**: ✅ Screen recordings available via attachment URLs  
- **Technical Details**: ✅ Environment specs, repro steps, configuration settings

## Implementation Results Summary

### Processed Issues (10 Recent)
1. **BETSYBE-8390**: Mobile filter sticky behavior → Archon task with viewport specs
2. **BETSYBE-8389**: Search state management → Archon task with navigation flow
3. **BETSYBE-8391**: Missing fullscreen button → Archon task with UI comparison
4. **BETSYBE-8380**: Tablet layout issues → Archon task with responsive design plan
5. **BETSYBE-8319**: Lazy loading performance → Archon task with loading optimization
6. **BETSYBE-8395**: Fullscreen filter conflicts → Archon task with z-index analysis

- ✅ **Reproduction Steps**: Complete step-by-step procedures preserved
- ✅ **Technical Context**: URLs, configurations, and settings documented

## Best Practices

### Task Quality Standards
1. **Actionable Titles**: Use imperative mood ("Fix...", "Add...", "Implement...")
2. **Comprehensive Context**: Include all environment variables and configurations
3. **Clear Resolution Plans**: 6-10 step implementation roadmap
4. **Validation Criteria**: Specific testing requirements and success metrics

### Efficiency Optimizations
1. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple similar issues together
2. **Template Reuse**: Standardized formats for common issue types
3. **Priority Grouping**: Process high-priority issues first
4. **Feature Clustering**: Group related functionality for better context

## Integration Points

### With Existing Workflows
- **Archon Project Management**: Tasks integrate with existing project structure
- **Development Cycles**: Priority mapping aligns with sprint planning
- **QA Validation**: Resolution plans include comprehensive testing steps

### Future Enhancements
- **Automated Translation**: Script-driven conversion for routine issues
- **Asset Automation**: Direct screenshot/video embedding in task descriptions
- **Status Synchronization**: Bi-directional updates between Jira and Archon
