# Claude Workflow System Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

## Overview

Streamlined workflow system for feature planning and implementation. Just you and me, no bureaucracy.

## How It Works

We use a structured workflow system to research, plan and execute features:

### Core Files
1. **init.md** - Initial requirements and objectives (you create this)
2. **implementation.md** - Structured implementation guide with copy-paste ready code (Claude Desktop creates)
3. **plan.md** - Todo-list style execution plan (Claude Code creates from implementation.md)

### Supporting Files  
- **prescreen.md** - Technical evaluation of current state (optional)
- **qa.md** - Q&A clarifications between user and Claude (optional)

That's it. Init â†’ Guide â†’ Plan â†’ Ship.

## Available Workflows

**IMPORTANT**: This list must be kept in sync with actual `claude-workflow/` directory contents.

### Currently Available Workflows:

1. **`preact-to-react/`** - Migration from Preact to React framework (Status: Research Complete âœ…)
2. **`rag/`** - Libsource RAG search MVP (Status: Research Complete âœ…)
3. **`interactive-workflows/`** - N8N interactive workflow system (Status: Research Phase ðŸ”„)
4. **`migrate-vite/`** - Webpack to Vite 7 migration with icon system modernization (Status: Init Phase ðŸ†•)
5. **`docs-chatbot/`** - NextJS documentation chatbot with RAG (Status: Init Phase ðŸ†•)

### Workflow Management Rules:

- **Add New**: When creating new workflow directory, update this list
- **Remove**: When deleting workflow directory, remove from this list
- **Status Tracking**: Update status based on readiness checkmarks in each workflow

## File Structure

Each workflow lives in `claude-workflow/feature-name/`:

```
feature-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ prescreen.md        # Tech evaluation of current state (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ init.md             # What we're building (your requirements)
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation.md   # Structured guide with ready code (Claude Desktop)
â”œâ”€â”€ plan.md             # Todo-list execution plan (Claude Code)
â””â”€â”€ qa.md               # Q&A clarifications (optional)
```

**Key difference**: `implementation.md` is NOT a plan - it's a structured reference guide with copy-paste ready code that Claude Code uses during execution.

## Workflow State Management

Use markdown checkboxes in plan.md to track progress:
- [ ] Not started
- [x] Done

When you say "continue workflow", I'll check where we left off and keep going.

### Continuation

When you say "continue workflow":
1. I check plan.md for unchecked boxes
2. Resume from where we left off
3. If multiple workflows exist, I'll ask which one

Never starting workflows without you asking.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: You Create init.md
Tell me what we're building. Include:
- The goal/objective
- Examples/links if helpful
- Any specific requirements

### Step 2: Prescreen Analysis (Optional)
Create prescreen.md with:
- Current state evaluation
- Technical context
- Potential gotchas

### Step 3: Implementation Guide
Claude Desktop creates implementation.md with:
- **Structured, copy-paste ready code**
- Step-by-step implementation order
- Testing protocols and benchmarks
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Quick reference sections

### Step 4: Execution Plan
Claude Code creates plan.md from implementation.md:
- Todo-list style tasks
- Markdown checkboxes for tracking
- References implementation.md sections

### Step 5: Build It
Claude Code executes using:
- plan.md for task tracking
- implementation.md as reference guide
- Test and validate at each step

Then we ship it. ðŸš€

## Tips

- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Focus on shipping, not documentation
- Add ASCII art or jokes sparingly (don't be annoying)
- Delete the prod database only on Fridays (jk, never do this ðŸ’€)

## When to Use This

- Features that need planning
- Complex migrations
- When you want a clear roadmap

## When NOT to Use

- Quick fixes
- Obvious changes
- When you already know what to do

Just ship it. ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
