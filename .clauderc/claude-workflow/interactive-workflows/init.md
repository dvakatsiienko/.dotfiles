# Interactive N8N Workflows - Initial Brief

**Date:** 2025-08-31  
**Workflow Status:** Research Phase ðŸ”„  
**Claude Desktop Research Required:** Yes  

## Project Overview

Create an n8n-based interactive workflow system that enables real-time user interaction, dynamic decision making, and intelligent automation orchestrated through Claude Desktop via MCP servers.

## Core Requirements

### 1. **Interactive Workflow Capabilities**
- **Real-time User Input**: Chat-based interactions, forms, and approval flows
- **Dynamic Decision Trees**: Multi-step workflows with conditional branching
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Pause workflows for user input, then resume automatically
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Support for text, forms, webhooks, and notifications

### 2. **MCP Server Integration**
- **Claude Desktop â†” n8n**: Seamless communication via MCP protocols
- **Programmatic Control**: Create, modify, and manage workflows from Claude Desktop
- **Template System**: Reusable interactive workflow patterns
- **State Management**: Persistent workflow state and user interaction history

### 3. **Workflow Categories**
- **Approval Flows**: Multi-stakeholder approval processes with notifications
- **Data Collection**: Dynamic forms with validation and processing
- **AI-Assisted Workflows**: Integration with Claude for intelligent responses
- **Decision Trees**: Complex branching logic based on user responses
- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Interactive dashboards and notification systems

### 4. **Technical Architecture**
- **MCP n8n Builder**: Programmatic workflow creation and management
- **Interactive Node Types**: Chat, Form, Webhook, Wait, and Response nodes
- **External Integrations**: Slack, Discord, Email, and webhook notifications
- **Template Library**: Pre-built interactive workflow templates

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation
