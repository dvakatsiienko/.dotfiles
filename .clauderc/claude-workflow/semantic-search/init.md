Hi. me and claude code created a feature called «libsources». brief info about it is is located in
/Users/dima/.dotfiles/CLAUDE.md a libsource example:
/Users/dima/.dotfiles/.clauderc/.membank/libsource/libsource-vite.txt libsource config file with our
libsources is here. /Users/dima/.dotfiles/.clauderc/.membank/libsource/libsource-vite.txt

scripts that do heavy lifting: /Users/dima/.dotfiles/.clauderc/scripts/\*.py

i've prepared a starting point for your research results —
/Users/dima/.dotfiles/.clauderc/claude-desktop-researches/semantic-search

these files are produces by gitingest https://github.com/coderamp-labs/gitingest they are a
snapshots of different libraries codebase represented as a compact .txt files adapted to be read by
LLM.

recently in voice chat today i've asked you about «semantic searches» and «vector-enhanced
searches».

we need to improve our text libsources with «semantic search enhancement» to improve search
efficiency.

###### plan

1. read current setup for this feature
2. confirm that current .txt files with libsources are simple raw .txt without any semantic
   descriptors or vectors embedings
3. then execute an extensive research about how to turn such a .txt libsource file into a
   semantically-enhanced version
    1. ask you told before, compared to simple text file (which is searchable by standard substring
       Search tool), semantically-enhanced text files (same files but enhanced with semantic
       descriptors) should improve search quality up to 300%-500% - confirm this during your
       research
    2. research how to create the most simple mvp of improving existing libsource transformation
       into .txt file into semantically-enhanced version
    3. previously you told that we'll need an llm for this. some simple but efficient llm would
       work?
        1. if so, research for best in class as for today llm to complete this task
        2. ideally this llm would be free, runs locally, and require no additional auth tokens
        3. i want a simplest possible solution to see how this process works and if it really makes
           such a search efficiency difference — i'll ask claude code later to verify this point
        4. what other tools are required for this automated operation?
4. as for now let's do not care about vectorizing all this stuff and connect to vector-based DB
   let's keep it simple for now
5. when you complete the research — provide me with report, will refine things, clarify unclear
   questions and create a comprehensive instructions for claude code along with key info
6. but first — research and report

###### Caude desktop clarifying questions

Current libsource usage pattern: How do you and Claude Code typically search through the libsources
now? Are you primarily looking for specific function names, concepts, or broader architectural
patterns? Performance vs. simplicity trade-off: When you mention "simplest possible solution," are
you willing to accept some accuracy trade-offs for easier implementation, or should I prioritize the
best semantic enhancement even if it requires slightly more complex setup? File processing scope:
Should the semantic enhancement process work on individual libsource files (like your vite example),
or do you envision processing multiple libsources together to create cross-library semantic
connections?

###### Caude desktop questions answers

Current libsource usage pattern — the libsources are an efficiently packed source codes of different
libraries claude code to implement code. these libsources are very efficient infomration source
because they contain entire (or almost entire source code of a library which is a very valuable
information source). they are intended for claude code to refer to these libsources during claude
code task executing whenever claude code is unsure about one or another feature, or do not have key
info to make an implementation, or it may use these libsources to optimize existing solutions by
search for more optimal was of implementation based on these libsources Performance vs. simplicity
trade-off — let's aim for preciseness. solution may be a bit complex if it brings noticeable
precision gains File processing scope: this is a complicated question. let's keep it simple for now.
first mvp should target 1 libsource with one goal — turn raw libsource.txt without semantics into a
semantically enhanced version of it. then we will think for smarter setups.
